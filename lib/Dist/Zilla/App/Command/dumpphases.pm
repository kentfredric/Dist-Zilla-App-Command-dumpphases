version 0.5.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cd $PROJECT;
  dzil dumpphases

  dzil dumpphases --color-theme=basic::plain # plain text
  dzil dumpphases --color-theme=basic::green # green text

=head1 TERMINOLOGY

Technically speaking, this utility deals with more than just "phases", it will in fact dump all plugins used,
and it will in the process of doing so, dump things that are part of the clearly defined "phases" that occur
within C<Dist::Zilla>.

However, if you want to be pedantic, and understand how L<< C<Dist::Zilla>|Dist::Zilla >> works, then you must understand,
many of the things this module calls "phases" are not so much phases.

At its core, C<Dist::Zilla> has an array, on which all L<< C<Plugin>s|Dist::Zilla::Role::Plugin >> are stored.

A C<Plugin>, in itself, will not do very much ( at least, not unless they do instantiation-time changes like L<< C<[Bootstrap::lib]>|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::lib >>

There are 3 Primary kinds of plugin

=over 4

=item * Auxilary Plugins

Plugins which exist to augment other plugins ( For instance, L<< C<-FileFinder>'s|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileFinder >> ).

C<Dist::Zilla> itself essentially ignores these, and their counsumption is entirely regulated by other C<plugin>s.

=item * Phase Plugins

Plugins which hook into a specific and determinate phase of the C<Dist::Zilla> build/test/release cycle.

These all provide primary methods, which C<Dist::Zilla> directly calls somewhere in its core codebase.

Good examples of Phase plugins perform L<< C<-FileGatherer>|Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer >>

=item * A Third Kind

There's a third kind of Plugin, which is somewhere between the other two, which I presently lack a name for.

Like the Phases, they provide primary methods, which are called by C<Dist::Zilla> directly, and they provide
information for infrastructural components of the C<Dist::Zilla> development process.

However, they're not strictly "phases", because exactly when they will be called ( or if they will be called at all )
is heavily dependent on usage.

For instance, L<< C<-VersionProvider>|Dist::Zilla::Role::VersionProvider >>, which is dependent on a few variables,
and is called only when its needed, the first time its needed.

Which means it could occur as early as creating C<META.json> or it could occur as late as just before it writes the distribution out to disk.

=back

This C<App::Command> command will indeed list all of the above, but for the sake of ease of use, the "Third kind" is informally
under the umbrella of a "phase".

=begin MetaPOD::JSON v1.1.0

{
    "namespace":"Dist::Zilla::App::Command::dumpphases",
    "inherits":"Dist::Zilla::App::Command",
    "interface":"class"
}


=end MetaPOD::JSON

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Working out what Plugins will execute in which order during which phase can be a
little confusing sometimes.

This Command exists primarily to make developing Plugin Bundles and debugging
dist.ini a bit easier, especially for newbies who may not fully understand
Bundles yet.

If you want to turn colors off, use L<< C<Term::ANSIcolor>'s environment variable|Term::ANSIColor >>
C<ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED>. E.g.,

C<ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED=1 dzil dumpphases>

Alternatively, since 0.3.0 you can specify a color-free theme:

    dzil dumpphases --color-theme=basic::plain
